          Brooklyn Candidates For US House Racing To Fundraise The Most Before
          Primaries

        <div class="article-header__dek">
          Incumbents are significantly out-fundraising primary challengers so
          far in the race to represent Brooklyn in the US House of
          Representatives.

          Fundraising is a crucial piece of running a successful campaign for
          political office. This year, Americans will be voting not only for
          their president but also for many other elected offices.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Significantly, we will be voting for our lawmakers from the House of
          Representatives. Before the general election in November comes the
          primary elections this summer.
        </p>

          According to data collection by the website FiveThirtyEight, the
          candidate who spends the most money in a race usually wins. More than
          90% of candidates who spend the most on House seats end up winning,
          but that doesn’t necessarily mean that successful fundraising causes
          the win. Data collected by the website Open Secrets shows that
          incumbents typically raise much more money than primary challengers.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          With that in mind, we wanted to look locally. How much have the
          various candidates for congress from Brooklyn raised as of March? Have
          incumbents raised more than primary challengers? I have pulled this
          data from the Federal Election Commission’s website.

          Brooklyn is made up of six congressional districts- districts 7, 8, 9,
          10, 11 and 12. There are 33 candidates running for six spots. Six of
          the top nine fundraisers so far are incumbents. And none of the bottom
          24 fundraising spots are incumbents.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          The only incumbents who are in the top nine fundraising spots are
          Nicole Malliotakis, who’s running to represent Staten Island and parts
          of Southern Brooklyn, and Lindsey Boylan and Holly Lynch, who would
          represent parts of lower Manhattan, as well as Borough Park and
          Bensonhurst in Brooklyn. Malliotakis received President Trump’s
          endorsement last month, who’s hoping she will take over the slot from
          Democrat Max Rose. She ran against Bill DeBlasio for mayor 2017 and
          lost.
        </p>
        <p class="g-copy">
          Boylan decided to run against House Judiciary Committee chair Jerrold
          Nadler in order to fight against the Trump administration’s policies,
          according to an interview in Teen Vogue. Lynch is also running against
          Nadler, after trying to make the ballot two years ago but failing.
          Nadler has been in office since 1992.
